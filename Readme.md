# dots

WIP bootstrapping library for osx & ubuntu (and maybe others!)

This is forked from (https://github.com/matthewmueller/dots), where you can read all about the design etc.

This fork reflects my own personal options.

## Installation

One-liner:

```
(mkdir -p /tmp/dots && cd /tmp/dots && curl -L https://github.com/thedavidfoster/dots/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zx --strip 1 && sh ./install.sh)
```
